            Here is all the documentation for assignment 2! In my circuit, when the button is pressed, the yellow LED turns off, while the green LED turns on and the last LED fades from yellow to green.

            I used three different LED lights (one green, one yellow, and a bi-color LED with green and yellow since my set did not have an RGB light), in parallel with each other. Since each light is supplied with 5V when coded to HIGH, to calculate the resistance needed for each light I used Ohm's Law (V = I * R). Yellow, green, and red LEDs have an approximate 1.8V drop, so the voltage that actually gets across is 3.2V. And since the current we want is 20 mA, the resistor I should use is 160 ohms. I used a larger, standard resistor of 220 ohms for each light. I also used a button to control the lights, and limited the resistence flowing with a 10k resistor, as we had practiced in class. The button only needs a minimal amount of current to work, so using a larger resistor is fine and lowers the power used.

            Each LED is controlled by the button, receiving 5V from GND when the button is on/off.<br>
		    digitalRead checks the button's status (whether it is on or off). digitalRead is used to turn on or off the green and yellow LEDs. analogWrite is used to fade the bi-color LED, in a for loop. Firmware code snippet is below.
