            Here is all the documentation for assignment 3! In my circuit, I used a photoresistor to take light input information to change the output of an RGB LED light. With different voltage outputs, there will be a different colored light (and brightness of it).

            <p>
            I used an RGB LED with a 220 ohm resistor, a photoresistor, and two 10k ohm resistors to make 5k ohms of resistance for my voltage divider. Since each light is supplied with 5V when coded to HIGH, to calculate the resistance needed for each light I used Ohm's Law (V = I * R). Yellow, green, and red LEDs have an approximate 1.8V drop, so the voltage that actually gets across is 3.2V, while blue is around 3.6. And since the current we want is 20 mA, the resistor I should use is 160 ohms for green and red, and 90 ohms for blue. Thus, I used a larger, standard resistor of 220 ohms for the RGB LED. For my voltage divider implementation, I used a photoresistor and two 10k ohm resistors to create a 5k resistance. I measured the resistance from the photoresistor in my environment, with 8.4k ohms when the light was blocked, at approximately 1.4k ohms when light wasn't blocked. Using the V(out) = R2/(R1 + R2) * V(in) equation, I calculated a maximum voltage of approximately 4.38V and minimum of 2.71V (using 5k ohm resistors, as I wanted to maximize the range of the voltage I could get).

            Using analogRead, I found the lowest and highest serial value readings I got in my environment (~400 - ~900) and divided that into three ranges to assign to my R, G, and B LEDs. I used if statements to determine when to turn on each color of light, analogWrite to actually turn them on, and used mapping to assign serial values within the color range to that specific colored LED's brightness. 
            My example serial monitor and firmware code snippet are below.
