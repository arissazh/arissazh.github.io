            My circuit for Assignment 5 uses 12V load power, an LED strip as high load ouput, an N-MOSFET transistor, and an IR receiver and remote as the input sensor with a library. Each number on the remote causes a different light pattern on the LED strip.

            <p>
            The transistor acts as a gate for the high current provided by the 12V power source to the LED strip lights. Since the LED strip is a series of 3 white LEDs and a resistor, the current running through the strip would be the same. White LEDs have a 3.3 voltage drop, so three of them would mean a 9.9V drop. Since the power supply supplies 12V, factoring in the 9.9V drop, there is 2.1V going across the resistor. The resistor is 240 ohms. Using Ohm's law V = IR, we can calculate the current across, 2.1V/240 ohms = 0.00875 A, or 8.75 mA. As some of my remote control settings, the LED strip fades on and off. Since in analogWrite the loop increments by 5 from 0-255, the for loop loops 50 times, and ranges from 0-5V, meaning each loop the voltage increases by 0.1V. Since it loops 50 times and there's a delay of 30 milliseconds, fading on and off (two loops) 3 seconds.

            I used the IRemote library and the in class activity example code to program a different combination of LEDs turning on when a certain button on the remote is pressed. The button pressed on the remote can also been seen, printed to the serial monitor output. 
            For this assignment, my input is the what the remote sends to the IR receiver when pressed, and my output is the LED lights turning on. Below is my code.
