      <h1>FP1: Final Project Prototype</h1>
        <img src="/hcde-438/fp1/fp1.gif">
        <p>
          This project builds off of my MP3 game by adding a leaderboard and score saver. In this prototype version, I improved my game over screen, 
        added an input name function to let users save their score to the database, and display a leaderboard. 
          My minigame can be played <a href="https://arissazh.github.io/final-prototype/">here</a> through my website!
          Here is my <a href="https://github.com/arissazh/final-prototype">prototype repository</a>!
        </p>
        <h2>Project Scope</h2>
        <p>During my initial planning phase, I think I had more ambition for the number of screens I would create; however, as I worked
            on the prototype, I decided to not have users create accounts as the purpose of score-saving did not require such complicated screens and steps.
            I narrowed my project scope to be less complicated on the score-saving side, and want to refocus for the next part on improving UI and user game experience. 
        </p>
        <h2>Time Management</h2>
        <p>I was able to complete everything I anticipated in this prototyping phase. It was difficult to know where and how to get started with Firebase, but after better understanding the 
            documentation, I was able to slowly figure things out. The pages have mininal CSS styling and are not perfect, but the functions and features I want are all basically there. 
        </p>
        <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
        <p>My implementation for mny final version hasn't changed too much--I am still focusing on the overall styling and game experience for the second part, although since I made changes to how
            the interface looks (centered on the screen), there might be a few new considerations to make when styling. Otherwise, my plan is to start with adding the fruit preview game feature, then spending
            the rest of my time on adding game instructions, screen styling, and finally, any special effects. 
        </p>

        <ul class="improvements" style="list-style-type: disc;">
          <li>Created a new repository, then cloning MP3 into it</li>
          <li>Create a Firebase project, setting up Firestore, and installing necessary modules into repo</li>
          <li>Setting up vite</li>
          <li>New Game Over screen appearing when the game ends</li>
          <li>HTML form for users to input a name, hardcoded with a score</li>
          <li>Link HTML form and score to Firebase--making sure that they are saved</li>
          <li>Retrieve and query through Firebase data for top 5 scores, displayed on leaderboard</li>
          <li>HTML styling to center the game on the page</li>
          <li>Fix canvas size to be relative to each other and the display</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Issues</h2>
      <p>
        During this project, one of the biggest issues I ran into was with deployment. Originally, I was building with vite (it ran successfully). However,
        when trying to deploy to gh-pages, it wasn't properly adding the necessary files to the dist folder. When looking in the dist folder (and through dev tools), I realized that it
        was creating some other index.js file that did not have my code, and the console gave me a 404 error. As an alternative approach, I instead reverted back to using rollup
        as it had worked for me during MP3. I kept running into a "cannot import outside of module" error. Following the terminal error message, this was able to be resolved by (1) changing the 
        homepage link in the package.json and (2) adding a --bundleConfigAsCjs onto the build command. These overall seemed to be more logic errors. 
        </p>
      <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <ul class="improvements" style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Preview of the shape that will appear on the next click, so that players can plan out a strategy (like Tetris)</li>
            <li>Add instructions</li>
            <li>Audio or animations to game completion</li>
            <li>Mobile compatibility</li>
            <li>Improved styling and interface</li>
        </ul>
