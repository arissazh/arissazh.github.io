        For my final project, I continued to work on my game from MP3 to improve the game experience by adding previews for the fruit type before dropping, saving user scores, displaying
        a leaderboard, and overall mobile and laptop UI improvements. Some of the biggest game changes I made included adding instructions, redesigning the fruit shapes, and providing a preview of the fruit before dropping.

  <h2>Issues</h2>
  <p>
    During this project, I ran into two minor issues: creating walls, and ending the game. Both of these issues were logic-related. </p>
  <p>With the walls, I was struggling to prevent the balls from falling off of the floor platform (off screen). When I created new sprites for the side walls,
    they both kept falling off of the platform thus no longer existing and preventing the ball sprites from falling off screen. Eventually, after looking more in
    depth at the p5play references and other demo examples, I realized that this was due to the declared sprites being set to a dynamic collider. I used p5play’s “learn” exercises
    to try and implement some code from my own project in their examples, and I eventually created walls with help from Hannah’s example game setupBounds function.
  </p>
  <p>One of the requirements for the game is to have an ending. For this project, I wanted the game to end when the fruits reached a certain height on the screen, and
    then display the score. I approached this by creating a static sprite indicated by a red line; when the sprite group Fruit (any of the subgroups) overlapped with the
    outLine sprite, allSprites.remove(). However, this only resulted in a cleared screen–the user could still place down new sprites that would just fall to the ground,
    the score could still update, and there was no indication that the game was over. I used console.log() to try to figure out where in the code things were going wrong.
    For example, I originally tried to use a while loop and a gameOver boolean to make clear when the game was ongoing, and when it was over. 
    I ended up approaching this issue by breaking sections of my code into different functions. For example, creating an “endGame” function that printed “game over”
    text with the final score, and a noLoop() declaration to make sure that the game could not be continued. This results in a screen-freeze and a clear indication that the game is over.

  <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul class="improvements" style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Preview of the shape that will appear on the next click, so that players can plan out a strategy (like Tetris)</li>
        <li>Animation or a slight delay when the shapes collide</li>
        <li>Audio</li>
        <li>Mobile compatibility</li>
        <li>HTML page with game instructions</li>
    </ul>
