        For my final project, I continued to work on my game from MP3 to improve the game experience by adding previews for the fruit type before dropping, saving user scores, displaying
        a leaderboard, and overall mobile and laptop UI improvements. Some of the biggest game changes I made included adding instructions, redesigning the fruit shapes, and providing a preview of the fruit before dropping. The 
        game can be played <a href="https://arissazh.github.io/final-project/">here!</a>

      <h2>
        My Development Process
    </h2>
    <ul class="improvements" style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li>Ensuring compatability with mobile--dimensions of fruits, canvas, and text changed to adjust according to screen</li>
      <li>Fixing game over screen UI, adding color, fonts, and spacing</li>
      <li>Creating previews for fruit before dropping, creating new functions to support having the same fruit show up in preview and drop</li>
      <li>Redrawing sprite images to be more consistent in style and size</li>
      <li>Scaling images to sprite size, as all were drawn in 2048x2048, and needed to work with different screen sizes</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Issues</h2>
  <p>In order to scale the sprites and the images to be reactive and usability on different devices, I had to do a lot of calculations and adjustments, which involved
    encountering issues such as fruits no longer combining, my images taking over the screen, and spontaneous game ending. A lot of these issues came from syntax errors, 
    for example, after changing the diameter of the sprite, there was only one fruit where there was a typo, so the game always ended once the peach sprite appeared. Additionally, 
    I used image scaling to ensure consistent sizing of images on different platforms, whcih required me to calculate formulas. When I did have the right sized sprites, my combine function 
    no longer worked, and I had to change from checking the diameter to checking the scaling. I resolved these issues through a lot of trial and error with functions, and creating console.logs to
    try to figure out why and where issues appeared in the code.
