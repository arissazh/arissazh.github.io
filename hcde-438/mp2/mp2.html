              This project uses the <a href="https://github.com/arissazh/webextension">P5.js library</a> to create six different sketches. The projects can be accessed <a href="/hcde-438/mp2/sketchgallery.html">here</a> through my sketch gallery.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are six sketches total, each building off of the previous sketch.
        </p>
        <ul class="improvements" style="list-style-type: disc;">
          <li>A static pattern of white daisies</li>
            <li>A static, random-colored daisy pattern across the screen--will look different every time!</li>
            <li>An infinite loop of random colored daisies being placed onto the page randomly</li>
            <li>An interactive screen where once clicked, random colored daisies are placed</li>
            <li>A single daisy that plays a note of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" each time it is clicked, turning the petals purple</li>
            <li>Seven daisies that change petal colors when hovered over or clicked, and each play a note corresponding to C-Major</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>My Development Process</h2>
          <ul class="improvements" style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Use p5 editor to create sketches</li>
              <li>Create daisy pattern</li>
              <li>Repeat, alternate random colors, alternate random positions for sketches 1-3</li>
              <li>Change placement "draw" to when mouse is clicked--added function</li>
              <li>Use in class examples to guide sketch 5 and 6, which involve audio</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
              I started with creating the sketches on the p5js editor site, and then transferred them into my github repo to make sure they worked properly.
              Along the way, I had to start over occaisionally due to the page refreshing adn sketches not saving, as well as having to redo parts of the sketches to meet assignment requirements.
          </p>
        <h2>Issues</h2>
        <img src="/hcde-438/mp2/photos/issue-1.png" width="300" alt="screenshot of in-progress canvas sketch">
        <p>
          After reading the assignment requirements, I realized that I had to make sure resizing the window would also make changes to my sketches. WHen I had started the sketches,
          I used the default canvas sizes of 400x400, so when creating my original daisy pattern, I used a for loop that iterated five times, since I knew that five flowers would span the whole canvas size.
          However, after changing the canvas size to be windowWidth by windowHeight, my pattern started offsetting, probably due me using translate and mathematical calculations to move the starting position back each time. 
          </p>
          <img src="/hcde-438/mp2/photos/issue-2.png" width="300" alt="screenshot of positioning issue i encountered">
         <p>
          I tried to fix the alignment of the pattern by adding values to the translate function, and while I was able to get the pattern to align, it would have messed up when resizing the window again.
        </p>
        <img src="/hcde-438/mp2/photos/issue-4.png" width="300" alt="screenshot of attempt at working around positioning issue">
        <p>
          I resolved this issue by adding a function that created a list of x coordinates and y coordinates where I wanted the flowers to be placed. When the flowers were drawn, they would be
          passed coordinates based on where in the for loop for reading through the coordinate list. This required a lot of debugging as I had to make sure the two lists were being read properly,
          so I used console logging quite a lot during this phase. However, once I got it working, it resolved the window resizing pattern issue!
        </p>

        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
          <ul class="improvements" style="list-style-type: disc;">
              <li>I originally wanted to make the interactive daisies rotate rather than being drawn on, it would be cool to build on this</li>
              <li>The daisy sizes in my sixth piano sketch don't resize with smaller windows, so maybe they can grow and shrink accordingly</li>
              <li>A wider variety of sketches!</li>
          </ul>
